# emotion-detection-using-EEG-signals
This project uses ASCERTAIN dataset--> https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309714707_ASCERTAIN_Emotion_and_Personality_Recognition_using_Commercial_Sensors
The project mapped 49 emotions to 6, using Thayer's valence-arousal model and found EEG signal features corresponding to the 6 emotions.
The mapped 6 emotions were converted to 4 datasets each containing the following emotions: 
1. positive and negative emotions
2. nervous and excited emotion
3. stressed and elated emotion
4. sad and serene emotion
Several ML features, optimization techniques and performance metrics were used to stud these datasets and derive inferences from it.

A survey paper on emotion detection using brain signals was also published as part of this project in Springer Book Series and can be found here: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-24051-6_36
